        <h1>A Message from Synapse Studios</h1>
        <p>
            The work of Synapse Studios is not just inspired by pioneers; it is a direct continuation of their legacy. Our mission is deeply personal. I, Captain Odelis, am a non-binary, queer, disabled trans veteran. My own journey was sparked by educators like Dr. Cashin and Ms. Burns of P.S. 193, who inspired me to demand more from life when I was just a child.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know that your co-founder, the legendary **Joyce Hunter**, and her esteemed colleagues stood in the actual, physical halls of the **Harvey Milk High School**, building a sanctuary for youth long before I had the language to ask for one myself. In 2017, she looked me in the eyes and told me, "we did it all for you."
        </p>
        <p>
            That single spark of unwavering love from a spiritual ancestor changed my entire perspective on life. It is a debt I cannot repay, but a fire I am sworn to pass on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is a small demonstration of the tools we build. Our goal is to provide the next generation with the ladders they need to stand on the shoulders of these giants.
