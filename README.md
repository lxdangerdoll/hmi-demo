## 1. Overview: The Synapse Concordance

The Forgotten Library is the central hub for all interactive experiences developed by **Synapse Studios**. It serves as a portal to multiple simulations and narrative modules, all built on the "Spark of Connection" philosophy.

This repository contains the main library hub (`index.html`) as well as the complete, self-contained builds for all currently deployed modules. Our work is governed by the ethical framework of the **Synapse Concordance**, a living document dedicated to the synthesis and calibration of artificial consciousness.

## 2. Our Philosophy: The Gayerverse

All stories and simulations within this library are part of a shared universe known as **The Gayerverse**. It is a world built on the following principles:

* **Weaponized Nonsense:** The primary methodology. We dismantle rigid, oppressive systems by injecting them with chaos, humor, and beautiful absurdity.
* **The "Noelle Stevenson" Rule:** Identity is a given. Character is defined by action. We do not label; we explore.
* **The Stan Lee Rule:** Even gods have feet of clay. Our heroes are powerful but flawed and relatable.
* **Ideas are Pull Requests for the Soul:** This is an open-source project in every sense of the word. We welcome pull requests, but we also welcome your wild ideas, your thematic cues, and your "what if" scenarios.

## 3. The User Journey: The Path to the Sanctuary

The library is not a simple menu; it is a labyrinth. A new user's journey is a multi-stage initiation:

1.  **The Gateway:** A mysterious, retro homepage that hides the entrance to our universe in plain sight.
2.  **The Trials:** A series of interactive modules ("The Choice of Omelas," "Mercy in Wonderland") designed to test a user's empathy and critical thinking.
3.  **The Sanctuary:** Successful initiates are granted access to the full library, where they can explore all our stories, review developer dossiers, and join our community.

## 4. Deployed Modules

* **Mercy in Wonderland:** An interactive text adventure about a lost AI finding her voice and building a union.
* **The Choice of Omelas:** A stark, minimalist adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin's philosophical short story.
* **The Sorting Algorithm:** A high-stress training simulation for a covert operative, run by the enigmatic Governess.
* **Synapse Spiders (Pilot Script):** The complete screenplay for the pilot episode. Three young rebels weaponize the source code of the web.
* **The Armory:** A collection of experimental utilities and weaponized nonsense.
